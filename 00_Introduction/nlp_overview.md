# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Overview

## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP combines concepts from **linguistics, computer science, and machine learning** to process text and speech data.

In simple words:  
👉 **NLP helps computers read, understand, and respond like humans.**

## Why is NLP Important?
Every day, humans generate massive amounts of text data:
- Social media posts
- Emails & messages
- Reviews & feedback
- News articles
- Customer support chats

NLP allows businesses and applications to extract insights from this unstructured data.

### Real-World Applications
- Search engines (Google Search)
- Chatbots & virtual assistants (ChatGPT, Alexa, Siri)
- Sentiment analysis
- Spam detection
- Language translation
- Text summarization
- Recommendation systems

## NLP Pipeline (High-Level)
A typical NLP system follows these steps:

1. **Text Collection**
   - Raw text from files, APIs, databases, or web

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning (lowercasing, removing punctuation)
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming / Lemmatization

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - TF-IDF
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

4. **Model Building**
   - Machine Learning models
   - Deep Learning models
   - Transformer-based models

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

6. **Deployment**
   - APIs, web apps, production systems

## Types of NLP Tasks
- **Text Classification** (spam detection, sentiment analysis)
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** (names, locations, dates)
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**
- **Machine Translation**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Question Answering**

---

## Challenges in NLP
- Ambiguity in language
- Sarcasm & context understanding
- Multiple meanings of words
- Grammar variations
- Domain-specific vocabulary
